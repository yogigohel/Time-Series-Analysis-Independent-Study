Time series data is useful in several applications. Here we will discuss notable examples from the textbook.

#### Global Warming 
---
This example is notable because it gives a preview of how time series data is not always a "direct" source, such as monthly average temperatures or daily closing stock prices. Here our data are relative to some "anchor" point, making finding a pattern easier compared to raw temperature data.

```R
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)

autoplot(globtempl, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Temp Deviations")
```

#### Returns on the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
---
This example follows from the previous one. Instead of plotting the DJIA directly, we first perform the following calculations to get data we want to plot:
$$\text{Return}_{t}=r_{t}=\frac{x_{t}-x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}}$$
$$
1+r_{t}=\frac{x_{t}}{x_{t-1}} \implies \ln(1+r_{t})= \ln(\frac{x_{t}}{x_{t-1}})=\ln(x_{t})-\ln(x_{t-1}) \approx r_{t}
$$
```R
library(xts)

djiR<-diff(log(djia$Close))[-1]
autoplot(djiR, xlab = "Time", ylab = "Return")
```

#### fMRI Imaging 
---
Here we have an example of a multivariate time series, where we work with vectors instead of single-variable data.

```R
autoplot(fmri1[,2:5], facets = FALSE, ylab="BOLD Signal Intensity")
autoplot(fmri1[,6:9], facets= FALSE, ylab="BOLD Signal Intensity")
```
