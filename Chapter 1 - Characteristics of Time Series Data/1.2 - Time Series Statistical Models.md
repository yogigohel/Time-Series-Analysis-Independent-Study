**Time Series:**
>"A collection of random variables indexed according to the order they are obtained in time."
>Ex: The sequence of random variables $x_1, x_2, x_3,...$ where $x_t$ denotes the value taken by the series at time $t$.

**Stoachastic Process:**
> "A collection of random variables, $\{x_t\}$, indexed by $t$."
> "The observed values of a stochastic process are referred to as a **realization** of the stochastic process."

**Graphing a Time Series:**
> The y-axis is typically for the values of the random variables and the x-axis is for the time.
> It is usually convenient to connect the values at adjacent points in time which treats the data as if it is a **continuous time series**. 

It is important for time series theory that a continuous parameter time series can be "specified in terms of finite-dimensional distribution functions defined over a finite number of points in time."

Below we will start seeing examples of generating time series.

**Example 1.8 (White Noise):**
> A collection of uncorrelated random variables, $w_t$, with mean 0 and finite variance $\sigma_w^2$ which is used as a model of noise in engineering applications where it is called *white noise*, and for the purposes of this text we will denote this process $w_t \sim$ wn$(0,\sigma_w^2)$.
> 
> When the noise consists of independent and identically distributed (iid) random variables then we denote this as $w_t \sim$ iid$(0,\sigma_w^2)$ or "white independent noise" or "iid noise".
> 
> When the noise consists of indepedent normal random variables then we denote this as $w_t \sim $ iid N$(0, \sigma_w^2)$ where $\sigma_w^2=1$ or "Gaussian white noise".
